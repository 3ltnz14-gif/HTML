        <h1>Most Popular Games of 2025</h1>
        There are many games that are popular right now, but the most popular <i><strong>by far</strong></i> right now is <em>Roblox</em>.<br
        ><small>Other ones that are not as popular but still very fun are Minecraft and Fortnite.</small></p>
        <p>Roblox is a (coding?) platform that lets users create their own games, and play games created by other users.</p>
        <p>The most popular roblox games are:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Grow A Garden</dt><dd>A game where; you guessed it; you grow a garden. This game is very captivating because of the fact that the shop restocks, and you stay in the game because of the fear that you might miss out on something good. I understand why people like this game, but I personally don't like it because I have the attenton span of a goldfish. (Haha...)</dd>
            <dt>Steal a Brainrot</dt><dd>If I could describe this game in three words, they would be: "AI generated slop". Everything about this game, the contents, the features, the gameplay, it's all AI. Unlike the last game, I dont even understand a tiny bit why people like this game. One minute, you could be the top player, sitting on the number one spot, and the next minute, you could be at the lowest point. It's really hard to see your best "brainrot" getting stolen. (The characters in the game are weird... I guess you could say... creatures?)</dd>
            <dt>99 Nights in the Forest</dt><dd>This game... actually isnt that bad! It's a survival/horror game where you have to survive 99 in-game nights in a (haunted?) forest. The game is pretty fun, and i've actually played it quite a bit. 
            <dt>Finally, my favorite, Forsaken</dt><dd>I love this game. From the unsettling vibe to the retro graphics, this game is... just... great. <i>Forsaken</i> is a horror game that involves one killer, and 8 survivors. The killer has to kill all the survivors, and the survivors
            have to run from the killer until the timer runs out.There are 5 killers, and 12 survivors, with their own unique
            gimmicks and abilities. The game is really fun, and I love it.</dd>
