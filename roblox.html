                <h1>Current: RIVALS</h1><p>
                    Rivals is a fast-paced 5v5 shooter on Roblox. 
                    It can be in first-person or third-person. 
                    It featured quick, round-based (1st to 5) combat 
                    that circulates around lightning-fast movement,
                    skill-based maps, and especially a wide range 
                    of weapons to choose from. There are four categories of weapons:
                    Primary, Secondary, Melee, and Utility.
                    Primary weapons include rifles such as the AR, and 
                    long-range weapons such as the Crossbow and Sniper.
                    Secondary weapons include special finishers like the Revolver,
                    or pure damage/skill weapons such as the Energy Pistols which
                    shoot extremely fast but requires really accurate and precise
                    aiming and tracking. Melee weapons each have a special ability,
                    like for Katana, deflecting bullets, or Knife, an instakill backstab.
                    Utility weapons include the Grenade, which can be used for damage or movement,
                    and the Medkit which can be used to heal.
                    It also includes special gamemodes such as 
                    <abbr title="Free For All">FFA</abbr> 
                    where everyone is your enemy or 
                    Mirror Matchup where everyone uses the 
                    same weapons.

                <h1>All Time: Fisch</h1><p>As the name suggests,
                    it's a fishing game. No, the title 
                    is not a typo. In this game, you 
                    catch fish to get money and buy new 
                    rods/boats. There are many 
                    different areas you can explore, 
                    and over 2,000 differnt fish.
                    Some are fictional, while the rest 
                    are mostly found in the ocean, and 
                    are actual fish. When you cast your 
                    rod, you can either wait, or shake 
                    the rod by pressing a ceratin button 
                    which makes you get a bite faster. 
                    Then you have to play a minigame 
                    varying in difficulty involving a 
                    line and bar to catch the fish.
