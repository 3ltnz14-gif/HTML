                <h2>Outline</h2>
                <p>These <a href="roblox.com">Roblox</a> games are some of the most popular games of 2025.</p>
                <p>Fisch; <br>is a Roblox game that was popular throughout 2024, but died, and since then, has made a comeback. It's about, well, fishing! A very relaxing game, except when you get a mythical fish, such as the Colossal Squid or Great White Shark.</p>
                <p>Forsaken;<br>is a horror/survival genre game that appeals to retro Roblox fans, as it takes inspiration from the 2012-2013 era of Roblox.</p>
                <p>Steal a Brainrot;<br>
                is a fast-paced competitive game where players try to steal a prized "brainrot" item from rivals while avoiding traps and defenders. Steals are short and chaotic, emphasizing stealth, timing, and quick teamwork. Every once in a while, there is an admin abuse, where the developer, SpyderSammy, uses his admin poers to spawn insane brainrots and increase luck.</p>
